Feature: Login Functionality
  As a user
  I want to verify the message displayed for not valid credentials
  So that I can understand the reason for the login failure

  Scenario: User enters not valid credentials
    Given the user is on the login page
    When the user enters a not valid username "invaliduser" and password "invalidpassword"
    And the user clicks the "Login" button
    Then the user should see a message "Invalid credentials. Please check your username and password."

  Scenario: User enters correct username but incorrect password
    Given the user is on the login page
    When the user enters a valid username "validuser" and an incorrect password "wrongpassword"
    And the user clicks the "Login" button
    Then the user should see a message "Invalid credentials. Please check your username and password."

  Scenario: User enters incorrect username but correct password
    Given the user is on the login page
    When the user enters an incorrect username "nonexistentuser" and a valid password "correctpassword"
    And the user clicks the "Login" button
    Then the user should see a message "Invalid credentials. Please check your username and password."

  Scenario: User enters no credentials
    Given the user is on the login page
    When the user leaves both the username and password fields empty
    And the user clicks the "Login" button
    Then the user should see a message "Please enter your username and password."

  Scenario: User enters a valid username and password
    Given the user is on the login page
    When the user enters a valid username "realuser" and a valid password "realpassword"
    And the user clicks the "Login" button
    Then the user should be successfully logged in
